Views and underlying stylesheets and scripts for my online resume

This repo comprises the code for my personal website, which serves as an online resume
with information about me, my work experience, coursework, and blogs. The site was built
on a free, bootstrap-based template by Karma http://www.templatemo.com/preview/templatemo_403_karma

I changed the sections, the navigation bar, and general organization of the original template 
to be personalized to my experience. Also, the template had a lot of beefy code and overhead since 
it builds on bootstrap, so I tidied up the original html and stylesheets a great deal.
