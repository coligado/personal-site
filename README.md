personal-site
=============

This repo comprises the code for my personal website, which serves as an online resume
with information about me, my work experience, coursework, and blogs. The site was built
on a free, bootstrap-based template by Karma http://www.templatemo.com/preview/templatemo_403_karma

Features that I implemented include:
- Sections that provide information about me, my work experience, my coursework, and my blogs
- Personalized, varied layout of the information in different sections
- Responsivity, such that the site resizes to screen sizes from mobile to 1200px+ desktops
- Clickable images in the slider bar that link to my other sites
- Stylistic touches, including color scheme and header/footer structure
 
Also, the template contained a lot of beefy code and overhead because it builds on bootstrap and
other javascript features, so I cleaned up the original html and stylesheets a great deal.
